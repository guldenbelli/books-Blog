				<h2>FALL INTO DARKNESS - CHRISTOPHER PIKE</h2>
					<h5><a href="bookReviews.html">Book Reviews </a> ;   10th of June, 2019</h5>

							<p>“You five made an interesting group. I wonder if you knew who loved who. Or who loved what.” — Attorney John Richmond to Sharon McKay


This is so good it’s difficult to know where to begin. Christopher Pike wrote this in 1990 and I have no qualms about calling this a young adult classic. Even that seems a slight, because Fall into Darkness is so entertaining, so enthralling, perhaps the term classic shouldn’t be prefaced by the young adult label. This is really that good, I kid you not.

In many ways, this plays out like a very old soft noir, black and white drama from the Golden Age of film. The only difference is that here, the setting is updated, and the characters are younger, just on the cusp of real adulthood — if they survive. Fall into Darkness begins with a bang, with Sharon McKay on trial for the murder of her best friend, Ann Rice. Sharon is poor but talented, so talented musically that she has been accepted to Juilliard. Ann was the beautiful and rich one. If you think you already see where this one is headed, boy are you wrong.

The “witnesses” are all friends of the girls in one way or another. Most attended Wonderwood High together in Utah. True to life at this age, romances and loyalties are fluid among the friends, and also true to life at their age, they often blame Heaven for woes they’ve brought upon themselves by their own actions. When Pike wrote for this particular age group, he always seemed to be writing for the slightly smarter, slightly more “experienced” teenagers, and it gives his characters a bit of bite, and realism. When they do stupid things, it’s because that’s how they would really act in a particular situation, and it rings true.

The narrative is mesmerizing, floating back and forth between the trial, and Sharon’s memories of everything that led up to the event in question. Though on trial for a murder she didn’t commit, everyone saw Ann and Sharon go for a walk near the cliffs. But it’s what everyone heard that is at the root of the murder charge, since Ann’s body has not been found. Ann screamed “Don’t!” and then she was gone. But what really happened, and why?

I really need to tiptoe around all the secrets slowly revealed as Sharon’s suave and astute attorney, John Richmond, — who may want a little more in “payment” than Sharon has planned — questions the young men about what happened, about the history of the girls in relation to the boys, and about the suicide of Ann’s brother. It is obvious to the reader that Richmond has figured out what happened, and has a plan to get at the truth. But even if he does get an acquittal for Sharon, is that the end, the real truth?

I wish I could say more, but this one has more than one twist, including some unexpected violence, and an ending that’s so, so…Well, you’ll have to read it to believe it. I can’t recall the last time I couldn’t put a book down, no matter how good. This one had me up half the night because I had to know how it all ended. Fall into Darkness has a page-turning narrative and terrific movement. The characters are written as real young adults of the time, giving this an edge. Everything about this courtroom thriller filled with flashbacks is top-tier. Loved this, and can’t imagine anyone not loving it. Highly recommended. </p>

		<h2><i>About Me</i></h2>
			<p>I am Gulden, 25 years old. Currently a student at University of West London on Saturdays and during the week I am a nanny to a 8 year old boy. 
This is my personal space: I will talk about my University days, modules, assessments and also discuss about one of my biggest passions: reading books. Not every book, though. I am a hardcore fan of Christopher Pike, a bestselling author of young adult fiction/horror books.<br> I also like pink things, traveling, drawing, video-games, movies and TV Shows!
