				<h2>SATI - CHRISTOPHER PIKE</h2>
					<h5><a href="bookReviews.html">Book Reviews </a> ;   20th of June, 2019</h5>
						<img src="images/sati.jpg" alt="Avatar">
							<p>
							I started a re-reading project earlier this year of books that make me feel most like myself. I’m not sure when or how Sati first fell into my hands. I read a lot of Christopher Pike growing up, mostly acquired from friends of my mom’s who loved garage saling and brought me boxes and boxes of books. Sati may have come from one of those as well–-certainly, my reading it was a natural offshoot of my love for his novels-–but I’m just not sure. My copy was hardcover and secondhand, but it didn’t look anything like the rest of my Pike books.

							To my continued dismay, my boyfriend at the time borrowed it and then lost it. He was a raging atheist who, having been raised a strict Christian, knew more about religion than most people (ironically, like most of the atheists I know). I was an uncertain nothing-in-particular who believed in just about everything as long as it didn’t come from a church, and I thought he might like a different perspective. I got a new copy when it was re-printed, but I’m still mourning the loss of the original; I’m sure if his mother ever found it, she set it on fire.

							Michael Winters is a long-distance truck driver in the middle of a divorce. One night in the desert on his way home from hauling freight, he picks up a hitchhiker. Sati is young and blonde, and she thinks she’s God. She starts holding meetings starting with Michael’s small circle of friends. He’s pretty sure she isn’t God, but there is something about her. Sati has a gravity that attracts and soothes; she affects everyone who meets her, and her primary message is one of love.

							I love pretty much everything about this book. The characters are flawed and sympathetic and human, and the narrative is straightforward and almost spare given some of the difficult concepts in it. The themes are similar to ones that run throughout a lot of Pike’s fiction, which is one of the reasons I’ve always been drawn to it. They feel real to me like nothing I’ve ever heard in a church has. I’ve read some criticism that the ideas in Sati aren’t particularly original, but I have to disagree. I’ve never read another book like this, that directly addresses spiritual questions, with flavors of Christianity and Hinduism and the new age, without being strictly denominational. This is not a Christian book; it’s not even really a religious book, but it is profoundly spiritual.

							My family wasn’t especially church-going, but we were believers: in God, in ghosts, in intuition. This novel is where I got some of my first ideas about religion. Like Dandelion Wine, it showed me that there was another way to live. That there was nothing to be gained by being miserable all the time, and that it was possible that the universe just wanted me to be happy, not in a hedonistic way, but in a real way. It was life-changing for me because Sati’s ideas are simple and universal, and they feel true–-but she doesn’t ask for belief, or for anything else. If she isn’t God, she’s everything I’d like to think God stands for. I like to think it kept me open-minded; I’m certain that it’s one of the books that shaped me into the person I am now.</p>

		<h2><i>About Me</i></h2>
			<p>I am Gulden, 25 years old. Currently a student at University of West London on Saturdays and during the week I am a nanny to a 8 year old boy. 
This is my personal space: I will talk about my University days, modules, assessments and also discuss about one of my biggest passions: reading books. Not every book, though. I am a hardcore fan of Christopher Pike, a bestselling author of young adult fiction/horror books.<br> I also like pink things, traveling, drawing, video-games, movies and TV Shows!
