	<p>Hello and welcome to my blog! My name is Gulden I am 25 years old and I come from Italy but I have Turkish origins. My zodiac sign is Gemini and I love pink color. It represents me fully! Spring is my favorite season and rose is my flower (fun fact: my name, in Turkish, means "from rose"!).<br> 
	I moved to London almost 2 years ago with my boyfriend and I have started my "Computing and Information Systems" course at University of West London one year ago, on September 2018. I have just finished my first year and I am so proud for making it until now. This is a part time course on Saturdays and I work as a nanny to a lovely 8 year old boy during the week. This lets me study and work at the same time. </p>
	
	<p>As you may have noticed, I really like Christopher Pike's books. He has a way of telling a story that nobody else has. I particularly like his sci-fi themed novels. I couldn't make up all of that and he has lots of them! <br>
	That is why I have decided to start writing reviews of his books. He is not known very well, plus he is quite an old author. He was very popular in the 90s. He deserved it all!
	<br>
	I hope you will enjoy my reviews and that they will help you choose the right book!</p>
	
	
	<p>Other than that, I have other interests, such as video games (I love single player games like Mass Effect, Fallout, Mirror's Edge etc.) and online games like League of Legends. We have a LoL team at UWL! <br>
	I also like to draw but I stopped a while ago when I started to get quite busy with life (university and my job). I studied Fashion Design since High School, in Italy and I was about to study it at UWL, too. Then I decided IT was better and I am discovering this whole new category! I think I did pretty well even though I have never studied IT subjects. I sincerely hope I will be this successful in second and third year of my university. </p>
	
	<p>Thank you again for visiting my blog and contact me, if needed, from the "Contact" section of the website. I would be very happy to answer your questions!
	<br>
	Love, <br>
	Gulden

		<h2><i>About Me</i></h2>
			<p>I am Gulden, 25 years old. Currently a student at University of West London on Saturdays and during the week I am a nanny to a 8 year old boy. 
This is my personal space: I will talk about my University days, modules, assessments and also discuss about one of my biggest passions: reading books. Not every book, though. I am a hardcore fan of Christopher Pike, a bestselling author of young adult fiction/horror books.<br> I also like pink things, traveling, drawing, video-games, movies and TV Shows!
