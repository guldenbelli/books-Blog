				<h2>ROAD TO NOWHERE - CHRISTOPHER PIKE</h2>
					<h5><a href="bookReviews.html">Book Reviews </a> ;   23th of June, 2019</h5>
						<img src="images/road-to-nowhere.jpg" alt="Avatar">
							<p>I used to devour Christopher Pike's books as a young teen and recently, I treated myself to a few of his books to see if they'd managed to stand the test of time... with this being one that I remembered as being particularly good. 

							I enjoyed it every bit as much as I did back in the day. I started it this morning, then voila, before I knew it, I'd finished it only a few hours later. It made for an addictive read!

							It's about Theresa, a teen girl on the run from her no-good cheating boyfriend and her best friend. She picks up two hitchhikers; Freedom Jack, a magician with a wicked outlook on life, and Poppy Corn, a miserable girl who spends most of the journey chain-smoking in the back. To keep themselves amused, they take turns to tell stories. Theresa tells the story of her own sad, failed love affair, and Free and Poppy tell her about friends of theirs, John and Candy. 

							As the trip goes on, things get weirder. They stop off to see Free's mum, who happens to live in a horror story castle and is a fortune teller. Likewise, Poppy's dad is a priest. As the road goes on, it becomes apparent that this isn't your normal road trip, and that things are going to end badly unless there's a bit of divine intervention at some point...

							As with all Pike's fab teen books, this was a compulsive read. He has an uncanny knack of pulling you right in - I personally think this is his greatest skill. Sure, it's a little over-dramatic in places; but hey, this is for a teen audience, and back then I lapped this sort of thing up. The ending was far more religious than I remembered, but it didn't cause me any particular problems. After all, it's a book that deals with some fairly weighty emotions, so it doesn't seem unreasonable that religion might sneak in there somewhere. 

							A very enjoyable trip down memory lane, and one that I'd recommend to teenagers now (or perhaps people like me who liked them the first time around!). </p>

		<h2><i>About Me</i></h2>
			<p>I am Gulden, 25 years old. Currently a student at University of West London on Saturdays and during the week I am a nanny to a 8 year old boy. 
This is my personal space: I will talk about my University days, modules, assessments and also discuss about one of my biggest passions: reading books. Not every book, though. I am a hardcore fan of Christopher Pike, a bestselling author of young adult fiction/horror books.<br> I also like pink things, traveling, drawing, video-games, movies and TV Shows!
